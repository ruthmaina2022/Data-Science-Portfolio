# Data-Science-Portfolio

## Introduction
My name is Ruth Maina and I am so pleased you’re reviewing my portfolio. I am very passionate about data and especially data science and all it has to offer. I am proficient in R, Python, and SQL programming languages, using tools such as Jupyter Notebook, Power BI, Pycharm, just to name a few. With the tools, knowledge and expertise I acquired in Bellevue University Data Science master’s program, I am motivated and very eager to contribute to the field of Data Science.

## Content Overview
This GitHub repository contains a collection of various projects I've been working on, highlighting diverse topics, skills, and techniques. Feel free to browse through the folders and explore each project in detail.

## 1.	R - Data Analysis Exercise  
This is a data analysis exercise using R programming language. Various visualizations using ggplot library are included 
## 2.	R - Markdown Exercise  
This is a two-part exercise that explores adult’s earnings dataset using R programming language. Basic statistics and relationships between the variables are explored as well as predictions of earnings. 
The second part is a housing dataset for house sale predictions that also explores how to perform transformations and multicollinearity.
## 3.	R, Power BI and Python  
This project provides visualizations using R, Power BI and Python. Chart types include heat maps, spatial charts, and lollipop  
## 4.	Storytelling with Data   
This project helps spread the word on the truth about airlines. The project is divided into multiple deliverables beginning with an executive summary of findings directed at the senior leaders that care about the portrayal of the industry and their airline specifically. A supporting blogpost is included with an infographic on the same topic directed at the general audience.  
## 5.	Python EDA - Exploration and Analysis of Smoking data
Covers a statistical question of whether smoking increases health risks to the human body and If so, what would be the effect of smoking on blood pressure, cholesterol, and any other health biomarkers.  
## 6.	Python Data Mining - Sentiment Analysis and Preprocessing Text exercise 
Project uses TextBlob Sentiment Analyzer to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, along with other text manipulation exercises. 
## 7.	Big Data – An Introduction to Apache Spark using Scala and PySpark
This project dives into Apache Spark’s capabilities using both PySpark and Scala as well as experimenting with data generation and transformations.
## 8.	Applied Data Science - Predicting Calories Burned by the Human Body
A project on Predicting calories burned by the human body to help curb the obesity pandemic. Weight loss is directly correlated to calories burned thus the research findings would help shed light on high-ranking variables that potentially would be of highest impact than other variables, thus enlightening individuals on areas of focus A real life application scenario is presented.  
## 9.	Applied Data Science - A Comprehensive Exploration of the Obesity Epidemic
The project is an analysis of Obesity using R programming language. My main data point is to explore obesity data for the last ten years, to let the data tell a story on how this is trending and perform a prediction of where this could go in the next few years. I begin with data prep, data cleansing, then I share an analysis and insight gathered from the exploration step, with screenshots of the code output embedded into the pdf document.
