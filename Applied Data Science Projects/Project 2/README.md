#### 8.1.  Applied Data Science Project 2 - A Comprehensive Exploration of the Obesity Epidemic
* This is an analysis of Obesity using R programming language. My main data point is to explore obesity data for the last ten years, to let the data tell a story on how this is trending and perform a prediction of where this could go in the next few years. I begin with data prep, data cleansing, then I share an analysis and insight gathered from the exploration step, with screenshots of the code output embedded into the pdf document.
* R code notebook file and a pdf of final whitepaper are included
* adults_over18.csv is the dataset for this project
