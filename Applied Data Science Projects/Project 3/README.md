#### 12.1 Applied Data Science - Airline Safety / Storytelling with Data
* The aim of this project is to provide information and trends on airlines as the safest way to travel, especially when compared to automobiles. 
* Using curated visualizations and storytelling techniques, the project will help multiple groups in the organization combat this negative publicity and help tell the airline's side of the story. 
* The project is divided into multiple deliverables beginning with an executive summary of findings directed at the senior leaders that care about the portrayal of the industry and their airline specifically. A supporting blogpost is included with an infographic on the same topic directed at the general audience.
