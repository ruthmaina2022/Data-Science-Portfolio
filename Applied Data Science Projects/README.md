#### 4.1. Applied Data Science Project 1 - Predicting Calories Burned by the Human Body
* A project on Predicting calories burned by the human body to help curb the obesity pandemic. Weight loss is directly correlated to calories burned thus the research findings would help shed light on high-ranking variables that potentially would be of highest impact than other variables, thus enlightening individuals on areas of focus A real life application scenario is presented. 
* Python code notebook file and a pdf of final whitepaper are included
* exercise.csv is the dataset for this project

#### 8.1.  Applied Data Science Project 2 - A Comprehensive Exploration of the Obesity Epidemic
* This is an analysis of Obesity using R programming language. My main data point is to explore obesity data for the last ten years, to let the data tell a story on how this is trending and perform a prediction of where this could go in the next few years. I begin with data prep, data cleansing, then I share an analysis and insight gathered from the exploration step.
* R code notebook file and a pdf of final whitepaper are included
* adults_over18.csv is the dataset for this project

#### 12.1 Applied Data Science - Airline Safety / Storytelling with Data
* The aim of this project is to provide information and trends on airlines as the safest way to travel, especially when compared to automobiles. 
* Using curated visualizations and storytelling techniques, the project will help multiple groups in the organization combat this negative publicity and help tell the airline's side of the story. 
* The project is divided into multiple deliverables beginning with an executive summary of findings directed at the senior leaders that care about the portrayal of the industry and their airline specifically. A supporting blogpost is included with an infographic on the same topic directed at the general audience.
